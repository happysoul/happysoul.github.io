<h2 align="center" style="color: LightCoral;"><b>Full Byte of Keys</b></h2>
<p style="color: green;"><pre><b>
<p style="color: red;">NOTE: I don't know if this code works or not. I have not had a chance to test it yet.</p>

	Someone emailed me with this question. If I understood the email correctly, this is what
he wanted to know.

<h2 align="center" style="color: LightCoral;"><b>The Code</b></h2>
	This following code will assume you've already strobed/reset $4016:

; after code is done, key will be in A
;--CODE START--;
ReadKeyByte:
	ldx #8
loopKeybyte:
	ora $4016
	asl
	dex
	bne loopKeybyte
;--CODE END--;

<h3 align="center" style="color: LightCoral;"><b>This Day In Review</b></h3>

	My appologies to the person who emailed me about this, I had this file sitting around
for some time. This file (if I haven't figured out if the code works yet) is part of my new policy
of putting up things even if tests aren't done or are inconclusive.

	Greetings 1337 Person!,
